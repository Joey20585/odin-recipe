    <h1> HOT DOG RECIPE</h1>

    <h4>height 500px width 500px</h4>
    <p>Iam  building a better bacon dog by using 2 smaller hot dogs instead of 1 larger one, which I will merge together <br>
        using the latest bacon-binding technology. Other than some potato chips, I think potato salad is the ultimate hot dog side dish, <br>
        so go ahead and serve this up with some.

        <h2>INGREDIENTS</h2>
        <ul>
           <li> 4 (2 ounce) hot dogs</li>

            <li>4 slices cold center-cut, thinly sliced bacon</li>

            <li>2 large hot dog buns</li>

            <li>2 tablespoons prepared yellow mustard, or to taste</li>

             <li>2 tablespoons dill pickle relish, or to taste</li>

            <li>2 teaspoons diced red onion, or to taste</li>

            <li> 2 tablespoons diced tomato, or to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>STEPS</h2>
        <ol>
            <h3>STEP 1</h3>
            Place 1 hot dog horizontally at the top edge of 1 bacon slice; roll once to secure. <br>
            Place the second hot dog on the bacon, directly under the first hot dog, and wrap bacon twice at an angle. <br>
            Tuck between the hot dogs. Tuck in second bacon slice where you left off and roll over remaining half of the hot dogs. <br>
            Secure the end between the hot dogs. Repeat with remaining hot dogs and bacon slices.
            <h3>STEP 2</h3>
            Heat a nonstick pan over medium heat and add bacon-wrapped hot dogs. Cook, turning as needed, <br>
            until browned on all sides, about 10 minutes.
            <h3>STEP 3</h3>
            Spread 1 tablespoon mustard over each bun. Add hot dogs. Top with dill pickle relish,<br>
             red onion, and tomato.
