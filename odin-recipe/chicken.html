        Iam cooking a 2 people chicken and the ingredients uses matches the number of people Iam cooking for<br>
        Fried chicken is a crispy, flavorful dish made by marinating chicken in buttermilk and spices, <br>
        then coating it in seasoned flour. The chicken is fried in hot oil until golden brown and cooked through<br>,
         creating a crunchy crust and juicy interior. Perfectly paired with sides like coleslaw or mashed potatoes, it's a comforting <br>
         and delicious treat.
