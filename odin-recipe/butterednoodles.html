    <p>Buttered noodles are simple to make with your favorite pasta, butter, Parmesan<br>
         cheese, salt, and pepper for a quick and easy, kid-friendly dish. Fresh herbs <br>
         and a little lemon juice could be added to amp up the flavor. Perfect to serve <br>
         either as-is or alongside steak, chicken, or meatballs. <br>
        It's such a delicious recipe, yet I get many questions on how to make it.
